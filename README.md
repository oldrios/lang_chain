# LangChain Chat with Your Data Study Repository

Welcome to my study repository, where I delve into the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the "LangChain Chat with Your Data" course offered by DeepLearning.ai and created by LangChain own developers. This course is a comprehensive journey into understanding and harnessing the power of LLMs to interact with custom datasets. My goal is to explore the capabilities of these models, learn how to integrate them with personal or proprietary data, and ultimately apply this knowledge to develop innovative AI-driven solutions.
